<h3>This repository has all the HackerRank questions that I solved during my journey of  5 stars in HackerRank.</h3>

***All about HackerRank***
- HackerRank, a coding-based technical skills and assessment platform, is one of the many tools used by Goldman Sachs to assess candidates for roles within Engineering.
- HackerRank is very good for beginners so even if you want to print your first program “Hello World!” then definitely HackerRank gives this opportunity to you. It has a   pretty good UI with boilerplate code pre-written that helps beginners to start competitive coding.
- As a beginner in coding I used this platform to boost my confidence as it awards stars after achieving each milestone.
- If you are a beginner I would recommend you to start your journey from HackerRank and once you are confident with your skills then try solving leetcode and codechef     questions.


***How do I start problem solving in HackerRank?***
- If a problem you are dealing with involves arrays, you should read about arrays and things you could do with them and so on. After this, you are ready to solve the       problem. Start writing the code. Make some progress, fail at a point and rethink the solution.
- HackerRank is a great resource if you're seeking to polish your coding skills. It has a robust free version, verified solutions you can check at any time (a useful       feature that LeetCode lacks), and a wide array of programming questions for you to solve.
- To pass the test cases, you must write the output from your code in the exact expected format. Refer to the Failed Test Cases or “Wrong Answer” Status topic for more     information.
- Test cases fail when the input passed by your code may not be in the exact format as expected by the test case. Also, when the output returned by your code is not the    exact expected output format, you will see a “Wrong answer” status.
